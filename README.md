# Hypothesis Testing for Relationship between Weight and MPG
This project aims to investigate whether there is a statistically relationship between the weight and MPG (Miles Per Gallon) of vehicles.
# Data
The analysis is based on a sample dataset of car data from 1970 to 1982 provided by Galvanize learning. The data is in the 'data' folder as 'car_data.csv'.
# Hypotheses
OUr team tested the following hypotheses:
1. Null Hypothesis: There is no statistically significant linear relationship between the weight and MPG of vehicles in the population. 
2. Alternative Hypothesis: There is a statistically significant linear relationship between the weight and MPG of vehicles in the population.
# Step for Analysis
1. Load data: The data is loaded into a pandas data frame for further analysis.
2. Sample test for 'MPG' & 'Weight': Generated random samples from the data to prepare for performing hypothesis testing.
4. Calculate correlation: Using 'T-Test', we computed correlation coefficient and p-value to measure the significance of the relationship.
# Hypothesis Testing
The correlation test determines whether the null hypothesis can be rejected based on the p-value and significance level.
# Visualization
Scatter plot and histograms are used to visualize the distribution of correlation coefficients and p-values.
# Conclusion
The correlation coefficient of -0.831741 between MPG and weight suggests a strong negative linear relationship between these two variables in the population. The negative sign of the correlation coefficient indicates that as the weight of a vehicle increases, its MPG tends to decrease.
Overall, the negative correlation coefficient of -0.831741 indicates a strong and statistically significant inverse relationship between weight and MPG in the population of vehicles represented in the dataset.
